    ZOOKEEPER-1061. Zookeeper stop fails if start called twice
    
    The zkServer.sh script doesn't check properly to see if a previously started
    server is still running. If you call start twice, the second invocation
    will over-write the PID file with a process that then fails due to port
    occupancy.
    
    This means that stop will subsequently fail.
    
    Here is a reference that describes how init scripts should normally work:

    ZOOKEEPER-1030. higher default for maxClientCnxns
    
    The default for maxClientCnxns is 10, which is too low for many
    applications. For example, HBase users often run MR jobs where each
    task needs to use ZooKeeper to talk to HBase. This means that each
    slot on the tasktracker will have at least one ZK connection. With
    today's beefy machines, that's easily 20+ connections per node. I
    would suggest bumping the default to 60, which will still protect
    against runaway nodes (eg a leak in a tight loop) but won't impact MR
    jobs that need to talk to ZK.

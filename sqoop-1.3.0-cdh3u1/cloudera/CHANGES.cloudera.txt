    SQOOP-172. Allow passing of connection parameters.
    
    This change introduces a new option that can be used to pass custom
    connection parameters while creating JDBC connections. If no connection
    parameters are specified, the system defaults to the old behavior.

    SQOOP-231. Typo in sqoop-import man page.
    
    The Sqoop man page for sqoop-import and sqoop-import-all-tables incorrectly
    specified the option for Avro datafile format as ----as-avrodatafile. Instead
    it should be --as-avrodatafile. Also included in this change is whitespace
    fix for build.xml and an addition to .gitignore.

    SQOOP-221. Sqoop Export fails for SQLServer 2005.
    
    This change introduces a new Connection Manager for SQL Server along
    with basic test case to exercise part of the functionality. It also
    addresses the problem noted in SQOOP-229 by overriding the
    getCurTimestampQuery method as suggested.

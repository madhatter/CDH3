Hadoop and others.

This repository is for storing and tracking the local Hadoop installation on my 
Macbook Pro. So, everything is running on Mac OS X.

While figuring out the HBase installation I thought it might be a good idea to 
keep track of changes I keep doing on the configuration file. So I should be 
able to deploy a stable installation later as often as I want.

Right now... I am not there yet.

But it's already possible to start the hadoop cluster in pseudo mode, start hbase and use 
sqoop to push your data into the hdfs or hbase.

Feel free to fork this and be my guest playing together with hadoop and deploying jobs on it.

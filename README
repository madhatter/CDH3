Hadoop and others.

This repository is for storing and tracking the local Hadoop installation on my 
Macbook Pro. So, everything is running on Mac OS X.

While figuring out the HBase installation I thought it might be a good idea to keep track
of changes I keep doing on the configuration file. So I should be able to deploy a stable
installation later as often as I want.

Right now... I am not there yet.
